Licensor:             Jonathan Fontanez
Licensed Work:        StreamLib
                      The Licensed Work is (c) 2025 Jonathan Fontanez.
Additional Use Grant: You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided
                      that you do not use the Licensed Work for a Streaming Service.

                      A "Streaming Service" is a commercial offering that allows
                      third parties to access the functionality of the Licensed
                      Work by performing any of the following:

                      (a) Offering a managed or hosted media streaming platform
                          that uses StreamLib to process, encode, decode, or
                          transmit audio/video content as a service to third
                          parties;

                      (b) Providing a commercial API or SaaS product where the
                          core value proposition is powered by StreamLib's
                          streaming capabilities;

                      (c) Redistributing StreamLib as part of a commercial SDK,
                          framework, or library that competes with StreamLib.

                      The following uses are explicitly permitted without a
                      commercial license:

                      (a) Personal, educational, and research use;

                      (b) Internal business use for evaluation and development;

                      (c) Use in open source projects licensed under OSI-approved
                          licenses;

                      (d) Use in commercial products where StreamLib is not the
                          primary value proposition (e.g., a video conferencing
                          app, a security camera system, a robotics application).

                      For any use not covered above, you must obtain a commercial
                      license. Two options are available:

                      - Commercial License: For production use in your products.
                      - Partner License: For consulting companies, integrators,
                        and strategic partners with additional benefits including
                        early access, roadmap input, and co-marketing rights.
