Licensor:             Jonathan Fontanez
Licensed Work:        StreamLib
                      The Licensed Work is (c) 2025 Jonathan Fontanez.
Additional Use Grant: You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided
                      that you do not engage in any Restricted Use.

                      RESTRICTED USES (require commercial license):

                      (a) Selling, licensing, sublicensing, or distributing the
                          Runtime (or any derivative work based on the Runtime)
                          as a standalone product, SDK, framework, engine, or
                          library;

                      (b) Offering the Runtime as a managed service, hosted
                          platform, cloud offering, or "as-a-service" product
                          where third parties interact with the Runtime's
                          functionality;

                      (c) White-labeling, rebranding, or OEM licensing of the
                          Runtime for redistribution to third parties;

                      (d) Creating a product that competes with StreamLib by
                          providing substantially similar media processing
                          runtime capabilities derived from the Licensed Work;

                      (e) Embedding the Runtime in a product where the Runtime
                          itself (or access to it) is sold, licensed, or
                          sublicensed separately to end users.

                      "Runtime" means the StreamLib runtime engine, including
                      the graph data structures, graph compiler, scheduler,
                      processor execution system, link/port infrastructure,
                      GPU context management, and associated infrastructure
                      code found in this repository.

                      The Runtime does NOT include Processors you create using
                      StreamLib's Processor API (see Permitted Uses below).

                      PERMITTED USES (no commercial license required):

                      (a) Personal, educational, and research use;

                      (b) Internal business use for evaluation and development;

                      (c) Use in open source projects licensed under OSI-approved
                          licenses;

                      (d) Use in commercial products where StreamLib is not the
                          primary value proposition (e.g., a video conferencing
                          app, a security camera system, a robotics application);

                      (e) Building, distributing, and selling custom Processors.
                          "Processors" are components that implement StreamLib's
                          processor traits (ReactiveProcessor, ContinuousProcessor,
                          ManualProcessor) to add functionality to the pipeline.

                          YOU OWN YOUR PROCESSORS. StreamLib claims no rights to
                          Processor code you create. You may:
                          - License your Processors under any terms (including
                            proprietary/commercial)
                          - Sell your Processors for any price
                          - Keep your Processor source code private
                          - Build Processors for clients as a contractor/consultant

                          This grant exists to encourage a thriving ecosystem of
                          community and commercial Processors, similar to how game
                          engines enable developers to build and sell games.

                      For any Restricted Use, you must obtain a commercial license.
                      Two options are available:

                      - Commercial License: For production use that falls under
                        Restricted Uses.
                      - Partner License: For consulting companies, integrators,
                        and strategic partners with additional benefits including
                        early access, roadmap input, and co-marketing rights.

Change License:       Apache License, Version 2.0
