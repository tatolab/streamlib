yes, fuck yes, per platform lets use the platforms approved and blessed approach to build it, redesign it (don't mean change the entire platform or anything fundamental, just how host and client work so we can fix this issue), address all the tracing issues so you can know each time things like camera is genreating frames but its not running through processors so you know when it fails, but th emain goal is the xpc approach, thats the focus, my instructions were just giving you additional boundaries
