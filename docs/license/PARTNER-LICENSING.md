## You May Not Need a Partner License

Before reaching out, check if your use case is already covered.

### Covered by BUSL (no additional license required)

- Personal, educational, or research use
- Internal business evaluation and development
- Open source projects under OSI-approved licenses
- Commercial products where StreamLib is a component (e.g., video conferencing app, security camera system, robotics application)

### Requires a Commercial License (not Partner)

If you're building your own product or service (not for clients), you need a [Commercial License](COMMERCIAL-LICENSING.md) instead. The Commercial License is simpler and doesn't include partner benefits.

## After January 1, 2029

On the Change Date, StreamLib automatically converts to [Apache License 2.0](../../LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt) and all commercial restrictions are removed. Partner benefits (early access, co-marketing, direct channel) would continue under separate arrangement.
