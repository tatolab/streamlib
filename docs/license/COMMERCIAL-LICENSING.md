## You May Not Need a Commercial License

Before reaching out, check if your use case is already covered.

### Covered by BUSL (no additional license required)

- Personal, educational, or research use
- Internal business evaluation and development
- Open source projects under OSI-approved licenses
- Commercial products where StreamLib is a component (e.g., video conferencing app, security camera system, robotics application)

### Requires a Partner License (not Commercial)

If you're a consultant, integrator, or agency building projects for multiple clients, you need a [Partner License](PARTNER-LICENSING.md) instead. The Partner License includes additional benefits like co-marketing and roadmap input.

## After January 1, 2029

On the Change Date, StreamLib automatically converts to [Apache License 2.0](../../LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt) and all commercial restrictions are removed.
