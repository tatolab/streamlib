   streamlib monorepo                     consumers: packages, examples,
   (builds itself in-place;              third-party plugins, the installed
    publishes versioned crates)          runtime building a module — all
                                         resolve from Gitea, zero relative paths
```

Truly-external untouched deps (serde, tokio, …) keep resolving from their
normal public registries — only StreamLib-authored **or customized** artifacts
go through Gitea.

## Two kinds of artifact

| Kind | What | Registry | Produced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SDK library** | the code a package compiles/runs *against*: rust `streamlib` crate chain, python `streamlib` pkg, deno `@tatolab/streamlib-deno` | cargo / pypi / npm | normal per-language publish |
| **Package** | a streamlib package (polyglot: rust + python + deno), loaded by `runtime.add_module` | **generic** (as `.slpkg`) | **`streamlib pack`, source-only** |

The distinction is load-bearing: SDK libraries are versioned registry
dependencies; packages are **source-only `.slpkg`s** in the generic registry
whose code resolves the SDK libraries by version when built on the host.

## Namespace — the `tatolab` org

Everything lives under a Gitea **org** named `tatolab`, matching the
`@tatolab/...` package naming:

- cargo: `/api/packages/tatolab/cargo` (sparse index)
- pypi: `/api/packages/tatolab/pypi`
- npm: scope `@tatolab` → `/api/packages/tatolab/npm`
- generic (`.slpkg`): `/api/packages/tatolab/generic/<name>/<version>/<file>`

The org is owned by a dedicated admin user; all four registries are reachable
as soon as the org exists and Gitea's package feature is on. The cargo
registry uses the **sparse** protocol
(`sparse+.../api/packages/tatolab/cargo/`) — Gitea serves the index from its
package database, so there is **no `_cargo-index` repo to create and no
web-session "initialize" step**: the registry is reachable immediately and
the first `cargo publish` populates the DB-backed index. Standing the
namespace up is scripted and idempotent — see
[Operational notes](#operational-notes).

## Resolution: by version, never paths

No consumer ever sees a relative `path` dep or a git `[patch]`. Each language
uses its native resolution, pointed at Gitea via container-level config:

### Rust (finalized in #1105)

Internal cross-crate deps use the standard cargo "publish a workspace" form:

```toml
streamlib-engine = { path = "../streamlib-engine", version = "0.4.30", registry = "gitea" }
```

- `path` is a **dev-only affordance** — cargo strips it from the published
  manifest (exactly how tokio et al. publish), so consumers see only
  `version` + `registry`. Local monorepo builds use the path (instant edits,
  no republish).
- `registry = "gitea"` is **required** — without it cargo records the dep as
  crates.io and `cargo publish` fails (`location searched: crates.io index`).
- The repo `.cargo/config.toml` declares `[registries.gitea]`; read is
  anonymous (publish needs a token).

### Python (finalized in #1117) / Deno (finalized in #1118)

- Python: `import streamlib` resolves the SDK from Gitea's pypi index via
  container-level `UV_INDEX` / `pip.conf` — no editable/path installs.
- Deno: a stable bare `import "streamlib"` resolves from Gitea's npm registry
  (`.npmrc`) or a container-level import map — no relative `../../../libs/...`.

### vulkanalia fork (finalized in #1105)

The `tatolab/vulkanalia` fork (`vulkanalia` / `-sys` / `-vma`) is published to
Gitea and resolved by `{ version, registry = "gitea" }`. The workspace's
`[patch.crates-io] vulkanalia = { git = … }` override is **removed**. The fork
shares crates.io version numbers, so the `registry` annotation (not a distinct
version) is what selects the fork over upstream.

## Packages: source-only `.slpkg`s (finalized in #1119)

`streamlib pack` produces **source-only** `.slpkg`s — the prebuilt per-triple
cdylib it bundles today is dropped, because a package is polyglot and source
is the uniform shape. Every `packages/*` is published as a source `.slpkg` to
Gitea's generic registry under `tatolab`. A host `add_module`s one, and its
rust/python/deno code builds on the host resolving the SDK libraries from
Gitea by version.

> Trade-off to confirm in #1119: a source-only `.slpkg` requires a toolchain
> on the consuming host to build the rust cdylib — weigh against the
> compiler-free-deployment goal.

## Schema-package resolution (resolver + strip capability shipped in #1116; cargo-publish wiring in #1105)

`streamlib.yaml` schema dependencies (e.g. `@tatolab/escalate`) are themselves
packages — they resolve from Gitea's **generic** registry: list the schema
package's versions, select the highest satisfying the declared semver range,
fetch that version's `.slpkg`, extract, resolve. The flat generic registry
has no semver-range query, so range → concrete version happens client-side
(cargo/npm/pip shape) via Gitea's package-management API
(`GET /api/v1/packages/{org}?type=generic`), and the resolved concrete
version is pinned in `streamlib.lock` via `ResolvedSource::Registry`. Two
halves, mirroring cargo:

1. **Consume side:** `streamlib-idents`' resolver implements the `Registry`
   arm — list → select-highest-in-range → fetch + `extract_slpkg` → load. The
   registry base URL threads through `ResolverOptions::registry`, falling back
   to `STREAMLIB_REGISTRY_URL` / `GITEA_URL` so build-script codegen picks it
   up transparently; `file://` is the hermetic local-mirror / test transport.
   A `Registry` dep with no registry configured fails loud with
   `RegistryNotConfigured`.
2. **Publish side:** a crate's bundled `streamlib.yaml` must be path-free so a
   registry-cached consumer hits the `Registry` arm (not a dangling
   `../../packages/...` path patch). `streamlib_pack::strip_path_patches`
   drops dev path-flavor `patch:` entries, exposed as `xtask
   strip-publish-manifest --dir <crate-dir>`. Because **`cargo publish`
   bundles `streamlib.yaml` verbatim** with no file-rewrite hook, the strip
   runs against a scratch copy before publish — that wiring (plus the
   ~28-crate manifest migration and the out-of-repo build) lands with the
   dev-publish script in #1105.

   > ~~`streamlib pack`'s `RejectPathPatches` strips the dev `path:` patch.~~
   > — Corrected 2026-05-30 (#1116): `RejectPathPatches` *rejects* a path
   > patch with a hard error (a distributed source `.slpkg` must not carry a
   > dev override); it never stripped. The cargo-publish case genuinely needs
   > a *strip* — the path patch is a legitimate dev affordance locally but
   > must be removed from the published manifest — so `strip_path_patches` is
   > new code, the publish-side counterpart to `RejectPathPatches`.

This is the schema-tier twin of the cargo-crate resolution. The resolver is
shared by all three runtimes' codegen, so the one fix covers rust/python/deno.

## The dev loop — one knob, publish-by-version

A change to an internal crate becomes a **published `0.4.x-dev.N` version** the
consumer bumps to — never a new path dep or `[patch]`. In the monorepo, the
dev-only `path` makes local edits instant; publishing is a release step. For
co-developing the engine against a separate-repo package, the same applies:
publish a dev version and bump — there is no relative-path escape hatch by
design (that "purity" is what makes splitting crates into their own repos a
no-op later).

## Operational notes

Standing up / verifying a registry namespace is scripted and idempotent. The
committed scripts are generic — configure the org / admin / URL via the
environment, so the same tooling provisions the central registry and any
self-hosted instance:

- `scripts/gitea/provision-registry.sh` — ensures the admin owner + `GITEA_ORG`
  exist and that cargo/pypi/npm/generic are reachable. API mode
  (`GITEA_ADMIN_TOKEN=…`) targets any Gitea — local container or a hosted
  backend — unchanged; bootstrap mode creates the admin via the local
  container CLI when no token exists yet.
- `scripts/gitea/smoke-test-registry.sh` — publishes a throwaway crate,
  resolves it by version, removes it, and round-trips the generic registry;
  self-cleaning, safe to re-run against a live registry.

Notes the scripts encode:

- One Gitea container hosts all four registries (cargo/pypi/npm/generic) — a
  single lightweight Go binary, no JVM. Local dev registry today; lifts to a
  cloud Gitea for the hosted/centralized backend unchanged.
- cargo token must be stored as `Bearer <token>` in `credentials.toml`
  (`cargo login` stores it bare → 401).
- The **sparse** cargo index needs no setup: the registry is reachable once
  the org exists and the first publish populates the DB-backed index.

  > ~~cargo index needs a one-time web-session init
  > (`/user/settings/packages/cargo/initialize`).~~ — Superseded 2026-05-29.
  > That step belongs to Gitea's older **git-based** cargo index. The
  > committed shape uses the sparse protocol (`sparse+…`), which Gitea serves
  > from the package DB with no `_cargo-index` repo and no initialize call.
- The generic registry (the `.slpkg` home) requires a **raw** request body on
  upload (`curl --upload-file`); a urlencoded body (`curl --data`) is rejected
  with HTTP 500.
- `cargo publish --no-verify` publishes source without compiling — the lever
  that makes the heavy engine chain tractable; consumers verify by building.
- Submodule-vendored crates (`vulkanalia-vma`'s VMA/Vulkan-Headers) must be
  published from a **non-git scratch copy** so cargo bundles the vendored
  sources (cargo excludes submodule contents when packaging inside a git repo).
- The `{ path, version, registry }` migration is a `tomlkit` sweep — rebuild
  inline tables fresh (in-place key-append corrupts comma separators) and
  exclude `dev-dependencies` (cargo strips bare-path dev-deps on publish;
  annotating them creates publish-order cycles, e.g. engine dev-deps streamlib).

## Reference

- Milestone: **Gitea Package Registry**.
- Downstream: #1114 (package/example repo split — packages become version
  consumers of the published `streamlib`); the `.deb`/Docker work syncs
  against Gitea.
